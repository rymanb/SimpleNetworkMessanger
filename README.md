## About the Project
Basic Windows chat application that allows you to connect to other users and chat with them. You can run the program as a user or server. As a user, you can connect either locally or over the internet to an ip running the server. As you send messages to the server it will interoperate your messages and commands to send them to the selected user on the network.
